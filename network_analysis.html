            <p>One of the biggest challenges to writing or speaking about transpacific migrant networks is making them legible for the audience. One of the most common means of doing this is to narrate from the perspective of one or a handful of actors in the network. There are more examples of this tendency than I can count, which all tend to fall in the great-man paradigm of history. Biographies of internationalist Nitobe Inazō and Shibusawa Eiichi come to mind. This poses two major pitfalls. First, because of a comparable dearth of materials written from women’s perspectives, if can be hard to grasp the role women played in transpacific networks. Second, by telling the story from one or a few perspectives, historians can misjudge the extent of networks. For instance, subject A may have regularly corresponded with groups W and X. But if W and X also correspond with group Y and Z on a shared project, then they are part of the network, too. I think this is one way in which emigrants are written out of both national and transnational histories–they are either overlooked or not deemed important enough to the larger project. Remember, the historical figures we may be basing our analysis on have an inherent interest in telling stories of international exchange in ways that overplays their own importance.</p><br>

            <p>Open-source network analysis programs such as Palladio offer a solution to this issue. In a paper I recently presented for the Harvard Reischauer Institute for Japanese Studies <a href="https://www.academia.edu/39757054/_Diaspora_and_Empire_at_the_Pageant_of_the_Pacific_Japanese_Americans_and_the_Japanese_Pavilion_at_the_Golden_Gate_International_Exposition_of_1939_">(link)</a> I used several network graphs made with Palladio to illustrate the support of Japanese Americans in the San Francisco bay area for the Japan’s Pavilion at the 1939-1940 Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE).</p><br>

            <p>This paper is based on Japanese planning documents for the fair held at the Diplomatic Record Office, Stanford’s Hōji Shinbun Database, and some commemorative albums put together by the Japanese American association created to help out with exposition planning. My main goal with this paper was to show how local immigrants were the public face of the Japan Pavilion and vital intermediaries for Japanese planners in organizing events. This was an extension of immigrant leader’s position as brokers of Japanese engagement with the American public more generally. To prove this, I wanted to show the relationship between Japanese American group such as the local Japanese Association and San Francisco Japanese Chamber of Commerce and the Japanese Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</p><br>
            <p>The biggest asset in mapping this network were a number of membership lists of groups supporting the Japan Pavilion. It was obvious from some lists that these groups shared members. Below is a graph showing overlap (shown by the connections in the middle) in board membership between the SF Japanese Chamber of Commerce and the Support Association (Nihonjin Kyōsankai) local immigrants formed to support the Japan Pavilion. From this we can see the Support Association had a diverse and larger membership made up primarily of local Japanese Association chapters, newspapers, and smaller business groups. The SF Japanese Chamber of Commerce was made up primarily of larger import businesses. We can conclude from this graph that the Support Association was a vehicle for mobilizing the broader Japanese community in California to support the pavilion.</p><br>
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/support-and-sfjcoc-19.3.jpg" width=100% >
            </figure><br>   
        
            <p>By adding other association lists to my network graph, we can see how the effort to support the Japan Pavilion had connections with planning boards for the fair back in Japan. Japanese planners in government, business, and universities formed two major associations to coordinate fair designs and exhibits: the New York and San Francisco World’s Fair Association, and the Committee to Select Exhibits for the New York and San Francisco World’s Fair. While these boards did not have any immigrant representatives, the graph below illustrates that various industries and ministries tied the two groups together: industry associations, the Foreign Ministry, Chambers of Commerce, and transportation companies. To show these connections, I had to make nodes in the networks employer categories rather than individual names.

                <img src="/images/ggie-4-2019.3-.jpg" width=100%>
            </figure>
                <br>
            <p>Finally, I wanted to show the place of the Support Association in the broader field of Japanese public diplomacy and world’s fair celebrations in the late-imperial period. So, I added other association board membership lists, including the Association of Japan International Exposition (for the canceled 1940 Tokyo International Expo.), the Association to Celebrate Japan’s 2,600th Anniversary (of Japan’s mythical founding by Emperor Jimmu), and the Japan World’s Fair Association.</p><br>
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/graph-5-groups-19.3.jpg" width="100%">
            </figure><br>
            <p>Again we can see numerous links that we can interpret as avenues of influence and cooperation between the Japanese community of San Francisco and quasi-governmental organizations in Japan dedicated to international cultural exchange and commercial promotion. While these links took this form in 1939, I argue with other evidence that these links were part of a long-term partnership between elite emigrants in California and the Japanese government and business worlds. If I had narrated this story from the perspective of SF Japanese Chamber of Commerce secretary Watanabe Hisakatsu, for instance, we would not be able to see the broader network within which local immigrants were an integral part. Certainly these immigrants were peripheral to the larger process of planning Japan’s cultural diplomacy of the area, but they had an important and ongoing intermediary role to play in promoting Japanese culture and commerce on an international stage.</p>

        <div class="sectionHeader" id="featureHeader">Palladio Network Graphing: From Sources to Graph</div>
        <div class="mainContent" id="featureContent">    
            <p>In a previous post, I gave a brief introduction of why using Palladio network graphs is a useful methodologies for understanding the reach of transpacific migrant networks beyond just one purpose. You can map out migrant networks outside of a strictly utilitarian view of sketching the various groups involved in spurring migration itself from migration promoters all the way to new social groups in destination countries. Mobile networks are involved in much more than just moving and assimilating into a new culture. Network theory in general has numerous applications, but for here I used Palladio to visualize the relationship between various groups that support Japan’s Pavilion at the Golden Gate International Exposition (1939-1940). I rely especially on the notion from Actor-Network Theory that some actors within networks work to mobilize broader networks.</p><br>

            <p>Palladio is a fairly versatile web platform for network analysis that seems to work best in tracking the relationships between actors who have correspondence. Think, Leonardo Davinci writing letters to other artists and patrons. By logging these letters in an excel spreadsheet and uploading it to Palladio, you have raw materials to visualize Davinci’s social and professional relationships and how they changed over time.</p><br>

            <p>If, as was the case with this project, you don’t have an inventory of letters to use as raw data, you have to get creative. I mainly had a list of members of various associations involved in planning events at the Japan Pavilion like the one below from the Japanese Support Association for the San Francisco Golden Gate International Exposition. These list provide board member names, their employer, and their position on the board. Occasionally, a single member would be on multiple planning boards, which would reveal links between the groups and help us understand how these links played a role in mobilizing groups for Japan’s late-1930s public diplomacy. I know that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a key role in organizing the pavilion, but those individual members would only be on one association board. A network graph based on individual affiliation would reveal no relationship between the San Francisco support group and pavilion planners back in Tokyo.</p><br>
            
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/screen-shot-2019-07-15-at-16.29.19.png" width=100% alt="List of name of the Planning Committee from the San Francisco Japanese American Community">
            </figure>
                <figcaption>

                </figcaption><br>
            <p>So, I structured the data to show links based on relationships between associations and board members’ employers. I used four headings: ID#, name, employer, affiliation (which association board the individual was on), and employer categories such as importer or media. The name category is not strictly necessary here. I kept it because the spreadsheet is also a useful reference tool.</p><br>
            
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/screen-shot-2019-07-15-at-16.37.15.png" width=100% alt="categorized spreadsheet with name, employer, affiliation, employer category">
            </figure>
                <br>
            <p>The links created from this data is more abstract than saying definitively subject A cooperated with subject B. However, you can still see which employers played the most important role in coordinating events at the Japan pavilion. We therefore get to see, in a general way, the structure of international cooperation between Japanese officials and emigrant intermediaries.</p><br>

            <p>Now that I had structured data, I saved the spreadsheet as a tab-separated-volume and uploaded that into the <a href="http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio-app/#/upload">Palladio new project page</a>
            </p><br>
            <figure>

            </figure><br>
            <p>Then I went to Graph, chose Affiliation as the Source and Employer Category and clicked “size nodes.” Then, presto! I have a messy graph showing relationships between world’s fair associations and the types of industries and ministries that supported them. By clicking on Facet below and selecting the dimension “Affiliation” you are then given the option of including some associations and not others. This allows you to see the relationship between specific associations and what industries and parts of government connected them.</p><br>
